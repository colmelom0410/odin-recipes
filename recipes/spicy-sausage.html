    <p>These sausage balls are as good as Bisquick® sausage balls, 
        but without the carbs and gluten. They are also keto friendly! 
        Eat them fresh out of the oven or refrigerate or freeze for later use.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper.</p>
        <li><b>Step 2</b></li>
        <p>Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin, egg, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands, a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized balls 
            (about 1 1/2-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.</p>
        <li><b>Step 3</b></li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes. Remove sausage balls and let cool on the pan until oil is reabsorbed, about 5 minutes.
    </ol>
